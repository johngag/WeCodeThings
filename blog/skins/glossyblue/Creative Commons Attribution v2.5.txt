1. Definitions 

   a.  "Collective Work" means a work, such as a periodical issue, anthology or encyclopedia,
       in which the Work in its entirety in unmodified form, along with a number of other
       contributions, constituting separate and independent works in themselves, are assembled
       into a collective whole. A work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be 
       considered a Derivative Work (as defined below) for the purposes of this License. 
   
   b. "Derivative Work" means a work based upon the Work or upon the Work and other 
      pre-existing works, such as a translation, musical arrangement, dramatization, 
      fictionalization, motion picture version, sound recording, art reproduction, abridgment, 
      condensation, or any other form in which the Work may be recast, transformed, or adapted, 
      except that a work that constitutes a Collective Work will not be considered a Derivative 
      Work for the purpose of this License. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is a 
      musical composition or sound recording, the synchronization of the Work in timed-relation 
      with a moving image ("synching") will be considered a Derivative Work for the purpose of 
      this License.

      License. 

   d. "Original Author" means the individual or entity who created the Work. 

   e. "Work" means the copyrightable work of authorship offered under the terms of this 
      License. 

   f. "You" means an individual or entity exercising rights under this License who has not 
      previously violated the terms of this License with respect to the Work, or who has 
      received express permission from the Licensor to exercise rights under this License 
      despite a previous violation.

         webcast) of the Work. 
 
      ii. Mechanical Rights and Statutory Royalties. Licensor waives the exclusive right to 
          collect, whether individually or via a music rights society or designated agent (e.g.

          version") and distribute, subject to the compulsory license created by 17 USC Section 
          115 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 

   f. Webcasting Rights and Statutory Royalties. For the avoidance of doubt, where the Work is

      or via a performance-rights society (e.g. SoundExchange), royalties for the public 
      digital performance (e.g. webcast) of the Work, subject to the compulsory license created 
      by 17 USC Section 114 of the US Copyright Act (or the equivalent in other jurisdictions). 
  
The above rights may be exercised in all media and formats whether now known or hereafter devised. 
The above rights include the right to make such modifications as are technically necessary to
