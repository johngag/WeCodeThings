/*
	custom.css custom styles for Cutline that YOU define
	------------------------------------------------------
	
	This stylesheet will allow you to futureproof your
	changes against future releases and upgrades. I know
	you work hard on your modified styles, and I don't
	want you to feel like every upgrade is a total drag!
	
	Instructions:
	
	In practice, you simply need to copy the CSS for the
	element that you want to change (from style.css) and
	then paste it here. Then make your tweaks as necessary.
	
	Here's an example:
	
	To change the default color of unvisited links from 
	blue to red (#c00) and remove the default underline, 
	this is what you would do:
	
	a { color: #c00; text-decoration: none; }
